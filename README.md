# JokeHub-Dev

For the final project, we decided to build a web application called JokeHub that allows users to share jokes. Once users are logged into the website, they can create, delete, like, and comment on different jokes. In the userâ€™s feed, there is a section for all of the jokes the user has liked and created. Users are also allowed to search for jokes created on the website. There is also a tab for a list of top jokes scraped from the website http://www.laughfactory.com/jokes/clean-jokes/ to diversify the jokes. Lastly, users have the option to change their username in the profile tab.
